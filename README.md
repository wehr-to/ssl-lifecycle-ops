# 🔐 SSL Lifecycle Operations Toolkit

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo covers the *full lifecycle* of SSL/TLS certificate management, including issuance, renewal, monitoring, failure handling, and automation.

SSL mishandling causes real outages and trust breakdowns — this repo helps ensure your systems don’t end up on an incident post-mortem.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

### 🔑 Fundamentals
- SSL vs TLS, chain of trust, cert types
- Understanding DV/OV/EV, SAN certs, and wildcard implications

### 🔁 Renewal Operations
- Manual OpenSSL + CSR workflows
- Automated renewal with certbot and cron
- Internal PKI lifecycle runbooks
- Renewal checklists for prod safety

### 🧪 Monitoring and Validation
- Expiry check scripts
- Weak cipher/TLS version probes
- Nagios/Zabbix plugin basics

### ⚠️ Misconfigurations & Failures
- Common errors: mismatched CN, incomplete chain
- Real-world examples (expired certs = outages)
- Debugging renewal issues (DNS, permissions, etc.)

### 🔄 Integrations
- Cloudflare + ACME DNS automation
- Using Vault for dynamic cert rotation
- DevOps-ready SSL secrets hygiene

## ✅ To Do
- [ ] Add Grafana/Prometheus SSL check dashboard example
- [ ] Add NGINX/Apache renewal reload integration
- [ ] Add Slack alert hook for upcoming expiries

## 📂 Ideal For
- Blue teams ensuring cert compliance
- Infra engineers maintaining web certs
- Developers learning secure web hygiene
- DevOps teams with internal CA setups
